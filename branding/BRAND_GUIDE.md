# AuthMind UX/UI Brand Guide

## 1. Brand Essence & Personality
AuthMind is an innovator in identity security. The brand personality is **Authoritative, Innovative, Observant, and Seamless**.

*   **The Goal:** Provide "Full Identity Activity Observability."
*   **The Tone:** Calm but urgent; high-tech but accessible.
*   **UX Vision:** Eliminate blind spots. The interface should feel like a "single pane of glass" that brings order to fragmented data.

## 2. Visual Identity

### A. Logo Usage
*   **Primary Logo:** Used on light backgrounds. Features the AuthMind wordmark and icon.
*   **Secondary/Knockout Logo:** Used on dark backgrounds (e.g., headers or dark UI mode).
*   **Icon (The "Mind" Node):** Can be used as a favicon or a profile avatar. It symbolizes interconnected neural networks and access flows.
*   **Clear Space:** Maintain a minimum clear space equal to the height of the "A" in the logo on all sides.

### B. Color Palette
AuthMind utilizes a "Cyber-Secure" palette—combining deep neutrals with high-visibility accents to highlight risks.

*   **Primary Brand Blue:** `#0062FF` (Approximate) — Used for primary CTAs and key brand moments.
*   **Deep Space (Backgrounds):** `#0A0E17` — Primary background for Dark Mode or headers.
*   **Observability Teal/Green:** `#00D1B2` — Used to represent "Healthy" status or "Detection."
*   **Risk Coral/Red:** `#FF4C4C` — Used exclusively for "Policy Violations" and "Emerging Threats."
*   **Neutral Grays:**
    *   Text (Primary): `#F8F9FA`
    *   Text (Secondary): `#ADB5BD`
    *   Borders/Dividers: `#2D333B`

### C. Typography
The brand uses modern, highly readable sans-serif fonts to ensure data density doesn't compromise clarity.

*   **Primary Typeface:** Inter (or Montserrat as an alternative).
*   **Headings:** Semi-Bold to Bold. High letter-spacing (0.02em) for H1s.
*   **Body:** Regular. Line height of 1.6 for readability.
*   **Monospace Typeface (Technical Data):** JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono.
    *   *Used for:* API keys, log flows, and NHI (Non-Human Identity) identifiers.

## 3. UI Component Standards

### A. Buttons
*   **Primary:** Solid Brand Blue (`#0062FF`) with white text. Rounded corners (8px).
*   **Secondary:** Ghost style (Border: 1px Gray, Text: White).
*   **Hover States:** Slight brightness increase (10%) and subtle drop shadow (`0px 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)`).

### B. Cards & Containers
*   **Background:** Slightly lighter than the main background (`#161B22` on a `#0A0E17` base).
*   **Border:** 1px solid `#2D333B`.
*   **Content:** Grid-based layout with generous padding (24px). Use cards to group "Identity Hygiene" vs. "Threat Detection" metrics.

### C. Iconography
*   **Style:** Monolinear (thin strokes) and geometric.
*   **Meaning:** Use icons to represent different identity types:
    *   **Human:** User icon.
    *   **Non-Human (NHI):** Gear or Terminal icon.
    *   **Agentic AI:** Neural/Brain node icon.

## 4. UX Principles (The "Observability" Framework)
1.  **Unified Visibility:** Never show a data point in isolation. Every identity should be linked to its "Access Flow."
2.  **Context-Led Design:** When a risk is detected (e.g., Shadow Access), the UI must provide the source and the impact immediately, not just the alert.
3.  **Real-Time Feedback:** Use subtle animations (e.g., pulse effects on nodes) to indicate continuous observation.
4.  **Information Hierarchy:** Use the "Big Picture" view first (Gartner IVIP alignment). Use progressive disclosure to let users drill down into specific identity blind spots.

## 5. Content & Voice for UI
*   **Action-Oriented:** Use verbs like "Detect," "Remediate," "Identify," and "Enforce."
*   **No Jargon:** Avoid "Leveraging synergistic solutions." Instead, use "Uncover hidden identity risks."
*   **Precision:** Instead of "A few issues found," use "4 Unauthorized local accounts detected."

## 6. Imagery & Graphics
*   **Abstract Visuals:** Use "Access Neural Network" graphics—connecting dots and lines representing data flows.
*   **Avoid:** Generic stock photos of locks or servers.
*   **Style:** Dark-themed screenshots with high-contrast data overlays (Glow effects on active paths).
