    "description": "Lack of MFA means AuthMind has detected that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has not been applied as a \u201cstrong authentication\u201d control for specified identities. MFA combines 2 or more security mechanisms (e.g., something you know, something you are, something you have) to authorize identities.\n\n**Importance:** Strong passwords alone are no longer robust enough. A second layer (MFA) provides defense in-depth. According to Microsoft, MFA can prevent 99.9% of attacks on accounts. Organizations should eliminate SMS as it is the weakest method and migrate toward OTP, private keys, or biometrics.",

    "description": "A hash is a small set of data mathematically tied to larger data sets (like passwords). In Windows networking (Active Directory), passwords are often stored as LAN Manager (LM) or NT one-way functions.\n\n**Importance:** Storing passwords safely prevents attackers from obtaining them even if the database is compromised. Authentication quality is considered poor if the password hash length is less than 41 hex characters. Legacy hashes like LM, CRC32, MD5, and SHA1 are considered insecure.",
    "steps": "- Enable SHA256 or another modern secure hash method on servers and services.\n- Use modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2.\n- Add a 'pepper' to passwords for an extra layer of security, stored in a secrets vault or HSM.\n- Upgrade legacy hashes (MD5, SHA-1) to modern algorithms (Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt) and re-hash upon next user login.\n- Seek a balance between security and performance when choosing a 'work factor' (number of iterations).\n- Expire and delete password hashes for users who have been inactive for a long time.\n- Use a hashing library that is compatible with Unicode.",

    "description": "A suspected identity brute-force attack occurs when a malicious actor uses a trial-and-error process to guess passwords for various accounts to gain access to the network and resources.\n\n**Importance:** A successful attack grants attackers access to network resources, allows them to collect sensitive data, and disrupts business operations while hiding their true identity. Additionally, the high volume of login attempts can cause performance reductions on the directory and service interruptions.",
    "steps": "- Review the information provided in the 'Suspected Identity Brute-Force Attack' incident on the AuthMind console.\n- Block or rate-limit the suspected source IP addresses (can be done via AD or IdP configuration).\n- Shut down suspected compromised machines (Hostnames).\n- Disable or lock the suspected accounts targeted in the attack.\n- Block identified MAC addresses on switch ports from accessing the identity.",

    "description": "An NTLM relay attack is a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack where a malicious actor positions themselves between an authenticating entity and the directory. They relay the authentication request to the directory and collect valid credentials or tokens from the response to access other assets.\n\n**Importance:** A successful NTLM relay attack allows attackers to access sensitive data, perform disruptive operations by impersonating users, and cause significant business damage.",
    "steps": "- Review the information in the 'Suspected AD NTLM Relay Attack' incident on the AuthMind console.\n- Block or rate-limit the suspected source IP addresses involved in the attack.\n- Shut down suspected compromised machines (Hostnames).\n- Disable or lock the suspected accounts used for the attack.\n- Block identified MAC addresses on switch ports from accessing the directory.\n- Limit or replace the use of NTLM (v1 and v2) with more secure authentication protocols (e.g., Kerberos).",

    "title": "Remediation for Suspected Directory/IdP Password Spray Attack",
    "description": "A password spray attack is similar to a brute-force attack, but instead of targeting a single account, the malicious actor attempts to gain access to many accounts using commonly used passwords. This low volume of attempts per account helps avoid triggering account lockouts and detection.\n\n**Importance:** A successful password spray attack allows attackers to access network resources, collect sensitive data, and disrupt business operations while remaining hidden. Additionally, the large volume of total login attempts can degrade directory performance and cause service interruptions.",
    "steps": "- Review the information provided in the 'Suspected Directory/IdP Password Spray Attack' incident on the AuthMind console.\n- Block or rate-limit the suspected source IP addresses involved in the attack.\n- Shut down suspected compromised machines (Hostnames).\n- Disable or lock the suspected accounts targeted in the attack.\n- Block identified MAC addresses on switch ports from accessing the directory.",

    "description": "This attack occurs when attempts are made to access assets from an unauthorized device or devices, violating the policies created by admins in Active Directory regarding which devices can access specific assets.\n\n**Importance:** Unauthorized device logins often indicate an ongoing attack to break into the organization's critical infrastructure. A successful breach allows attackers to access network resources, collect sensitive data, and disrupt business operations.",
    "steps": "- Review the information provided in the incident for 'Repeated Login Attempts from Invalid Device' on AuthMind\u2019s console.\n- Block the suspected source IP addresses of the attacker.\n- Shut down suspected compromised machines (Hostnames).\n- Block identified MAC addresses on the switch ports from accessing the directory.",

When attempts are made to access these assets outside the permitted times, it is classified as a 'Repeated Login Attempts at Invalid Time' attack.\n\n**Importance:** Logins outside the permitted time could indicate an attack underway to break into the organization\u2019s critical infrastructure. A successful attack allows the attacker to access resources, collect sensitive data, and disrupt business operations.",

    "description": "A Golden Ticket attack is a severe cybersecurity threat in Active Directory environments where an attacker forges a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any user, including Domain Admins, to acquire persistent access to AD resources.\n\n**Importance:** This attack exploits the KRBTGT account, which signs Kerberos tickets. It allows attackers to bypass traditional security measures and maintain prolonged unauthorized access to the core identity system.",
    "steps": "- Review the incident details for 'Suspected AD Golden Ticket Attack' in the AuthMind console.\n- Reset the KRBTGT account password twice. This is necessary because the account retains two password versions (current and previous), and resetting it twice invalidates all existing Kerberos tickets, including forged ones.\n- Identify the attacker using the AuthMind Identity Posture page to spot unusual access patterns or tools like Mimikatz.\n- Revoke existing Kerberos tickets by restarting services or forcing re-authentication.\n- Verify that Domain Admin and other privileged accounts are not compromised; reset their passwords if necessary.\n- Monitor for persistence mechanisms like scheduled tasks, registry modifications, or backdoor accounts.",

    "title": "Remediation for Suspected AD Pass-the-Ticket Attack",
    "description": "A Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) attack is a technique where an attacker exploits a stolen Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) or Service Ticket to gain unauthorized access to systems and resources within a network. Instead of compromising credentials, the attacker directly reuses a valid ticket to impersonate a user.\n\n**Importance:** Defending against these attacks is crucial as they target the core of an organization\u2019s identity and authentication system (Kerberos). If left unchecked, they can lead to severe security breaches and prolonged unauthorized access that evades traditional security measures.",
    "steps": "**Immediate Containment**\n- Identify and isolate the compromised systems.\n- Revoke tickets by forcing re-authentication of all accounts.\n- Reset passwords for all compromised accounts.\n\n**Long-Term Hardening**\n- Strengthen the Kerberos environment by resetting the KRBTGT account.\n- Reinforce regular monitoring of logs.\n- Enforce security best practices like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and network segmentation.\n- Adopt zero trust principles and conduct regular penetration testing.",
